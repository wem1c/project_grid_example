# "What am I looking at?"

Just the other day my friend was showing a local [architecture studio's website](https://aim-studio.me/), and I was quite pleased with the homepage!

It was a fullscreen grid of projects, with the preview image of each project being set as the background of the entire page. As you hover over each project tile, the background image would change to the hovered project's image.

Quite a simple design, I thought. And I told my friend. "I know just how I would do this!". But for the sake of actually doing it and getting the pratice in, as well as for the experience and exploring of different methods, particularly in Next.js, I took a few hours and recreated it!

That is the repo you are looking at.
